      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">The following suggestions
      presume that the reed is made with the standard American long
      scrape as illustrated in the accompanying <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~schuring/Oboe/diagram.html" target="_blank">diagram</a>.</font></p>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">The performance of a reed
      can be described using four basic criteria: response, resistance,
      tone quality, and stability.</font></p>

      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Response: This refers to
        the reed's ability to speak freely at all dynamic levels. It
        should speak easily at the softest possible dynamic while maintaining
        a true sound, and it should speak cleanly at a loud dynamic without
        splattering or spreading. These characteristics should be consistent
        in all registers. <br>
<br>
        </font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Resistance: Resistance describes
        how much air the reed will accept and how readily it accepts
        it. It should be possible to play your full dynamic range with
        very little embouchure intervention except at the softest dynamics.
        No-one can maintain good control and endurance on a reed that
        requires constant embouchure action. A reed that is too easy
        (resistance too low) is as tiring as a reed that is too hard
        (resistance too high). Although the embouchure is very free on
        a too-easy reed, the tendency to search for more tone and overblow
        can cause fatigue very quickly. <br>
<br>
        Here's a good test to determine the reed's overall resistance
        level. First confirm that the reed opening is correct. Then,
        with the reed in the oboe, blow gently through it with a neutral
        embouchure. Don't try to influence the tone in any way. Gradually
        increase the air pressure until the reed speaks by itself. The
        resulting dynamic should be mezzo-piano or very close to it.
        If it is too loud, the reed will be too hard to play easily;
        if it is too soft, the reed will feel "limited" and
        not project well. It is essential for the reed's resistance to
        correctly match the player's physical capacity. Any deviation
        will result in uncomfortable playing and rapid fatigue.<br>
<br>
        In addition, we can describe another aspect of resistance - hardness
        - that refers to the amount of embouchure tension (preferably
        minimal) needed to keep the reed behaving. Before making a judgment
        about the reed's hardness (and possibly ruining it), always confirm
        that the opening is not too large. Squeeze the opening to a comfortable
        size and try the reed again.<br>
<br>
        </font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Tone Quality: The actual
        timbre of the sound is a personal matter, and not important here.
        It is important to get a good balance between low and high partials,
        allowing the sound to be as complex and rich as possible. A reed
        that has only the lower partials will sound dull, lack brilliance,
        and will not project. Do not confuse this with making a dark
        sound. A reed that has only the higher partials will sound shrill
        and thin. <br>
<br>
        </font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Stability: Refers both to
        the reed's overall pitch tendency as well as its ability to maintain
        that pitch. Reeds can manifest a confusing variety of combinations:
        flat and stable, flat and wild, sharp and wild, sharp and dull,
        etc. Some of these have no ready solution. Ideally, the reed
        should play in tune and hold its pitch at any dynamic, at any
        level of air pressure, and with any reasonable variation of embouchure
        tension or reed placement in the mouth.</font>
      </li></ul>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Remember that anything you
      do to a reed affects all four of the above considerations. You
      will seldom cure one problem without creating another. Success
      in the diagnostic process consists of finding the solution that
      removes the most problems and creates the fewest new ones. Even
      inexperienced reedmakers can usually get the intended result
      from a scraping operation; the skill lies in anticipating the
      unintended results. Think before you scrape! Keep notes if necessary.
<br>
<br>
      However, the best reed-making is purely intuitive - you just
      know what to do. This knowledge is the result of experience,
      so don't be afraid to experiment occasionally - even recklessly
      - to see what happens. You may learn something. </font></p>

      <h3><font size="+0" face="Helvetica">Three Golden Rules of Reed
      Making</font></h3>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">1. Sharpen your knife.<br>
      2. Don't make any mistakes.<br>
      3. Adjust the function of the reed, not the tone. <br>
      </font></p>

      <h3><font size="+0" face="Helvetica">Common actions and their
      effects...</font></h3>

      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Scraping the whole surface
        of the tip thinner.</font>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Easier response</font>
          </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Lower resistance</font>

          sound</font>
          </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Slightly flatter pitch and
          decreased stability<br>
<br>
          If the reed is nearly finished, scraping the whole tip is seldom
          a good idea. It tends to make the reed chirpy and shrill because
          it emphasizes the tip vibrations too much. In this case, it's
          usually better to try to get more vibrations some other way -
          scraping the heart a bit, for instance - and then finishing just
          the sides and corners of the tip. Scraping the tip makes the
          tip vibrate better; it doesn't necessarily make the reed vibrate
          better. <br>
          </font>
        </li></ul>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Scraping just the extremities
        of the tip (sides and corners - "finishing the tip").</font>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Somewhat easier response</font>
          </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Somewhat lower resistance</font>

          </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Minimal effect on pitch
          and stability<br>
<br>
          If done carefully, finishing the tip can actually improve stability
          without affecting the pitch. Often, finishing the tip will unify
          all the elements of the reed after everything else looks all
          right. It should be among the last things you do to a reed and
          always with a very sharp knife.<br>

<br>
          Before clipping the tip, be sure it really needs clipping. The
          reed should feel a little loose and play a little flat. Clip
          to improve the function of the reed, not the tone. Clipping a
          bright, sharp reed that doesn't vibrate well to make it sound
          darker won't help it a bit. Always clip off the tiniest possible
          amount; it's better to clip a reed three times to get what you
          want than to clip it too much once. <br>
          </font>

<br>
          This is often the cure for a stodgy, wooden reed that refuses
          to vibrate. Try to stay away from the center of the heart unless
          the reed just doesn't vibrate at all. The heart acts like a valve
          between the tip and the back. If it's too thick, the tip vibrations
          will not continue, and the reed will feel stuffy and resistant.
          If it's too thin, the reed becomes loose and noisy - as though
          the tip were much too long. <br>

          After the first roughing-out stages, wood should mostly be removed
          from the top of the back, blending as you get closer to the string.
          Making the whole back thin weakens the reed too much. Be sure,
          also, to leave a visible spine down the center and rails along
          each side to provide structure. Avoid having too much of a hump
          between the top of the back and the heart - blend it smoothly.<br>

      <h3><font size="+0" face="Helvetica">POSSIBLE CURES FOR COMMON
      PROBLEMS</font></h3>

      <h4><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Reed too flat.</font></h4>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica"><br>
      There are several things that can cause this problem: the opening
      is too big, the reed is well-made but too large, the overlap
      is too slight, or too much wood has been removed from the reed.
      It can also be a combination of these factors. <br>
<br>
      If the opening seems too large, always take care of that first.
      Soak the reed well and, with the plaque inserted, squeeze just
      behind the tip gently, holding the reed between your thumb and
      index finger. Once you're pretty sure it won't crack, squeeze
      harder. Then, gradually squeeze a little closer to the string.
      Finally, squeeze as hard and as close to the string as you dare.
      Twist the tube back and forth a little to weaken the reed further.
      If it cracks now, don't worry too much; it would have cracked
      sooner or later anyway. Better now than during a concert. This
      is the only effective way to make the opening smaller. Weakening
      the reed by scraping is not effective. The next time you soak
      the reed, the opening will probably be too large again. Repeat
      the squeezing procedure, and after a few days it should settle
      down. <br>
<br>
      If the reed seems to play well but just a bit flat, it probably
      needs to have the tip clipped. Be careful to clip only the tiniest
      amount at a time and try the reed after each clip. You can raise
      the pitch slightly by increasing the amount that the blades overlap.
      Gently slip the blades a little apart. Note that this will also
      make the tone less vibrant. <br>
<br>
      If the reed is flat because too much wood has been removed, it
      may be difficult to remake. Usually, this happens if the back
      or the heart (or both) have been scraped too thin. Try clipping
      it a little. Chances are the pitch will improve but the sound
      will not. Be prepared to give up and make a new reed without
      making the same mistakes. <br>
<br>
      The general order of operation in the case of a flat, but otherwise
      well-made, reed is to clip it until it crows "C", then
      loosen it up if necessary, clip again if necessary, etc. The
      closer you get to an acceptable result the smaller the adjustments
      should be. Try the reed after every (tiny) clip and after every
      (minimal) scraping procedure. As a rule of thumb, do not let
      the crow drop lower than "B" while finishing the reed.
      Then, you will always be able to restore the pitch by clipping.<br>
      </font></p>

      <h4><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Reed too sharp</font></h4>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Sharpness can be due to the
      opening being too small, the reed being too short, too great
      an overlap, or too much wood being left on the reed. Sharpness
      is much less common than flatness.<br>
<br>
      If the opening is too small, there is usually no remedy. Try
      soaking the reed for a good long time (15-20 minutes) and see
      if it improves. Squeezing it gently open with you fingers is
      a temporary solution. Some people recommend changing the shape
      of the tube with pliers to adjust the opening, but this distorts
      the reed and ruins the tube. If you get consistently small openings,
      try using cane with a smaller diameter, and/or a wider shaper
      tip, and/or tying the reeds on a little longer (but keeping the
      same finished length). Also, make sure that the cane you use
      has good resilience. It it's mushy and collapses easily, no amount
      of correction will help much.<br>
<br>
      If the reed is clipped too short, it's probably hopeless. Often
      this is the result of carelessly clipping too much and then scraping
      too much, clipping, scraping, etc. Be more careful.<br>
<br>
      The overlap can be reduced by slipping the blades more nearly
      on top of each other. This will also make the tone more resonant,
      but is at best a temporary solution - the blades will slide back
      to their original position after a while. <br>
<br>
      If the reed is sharp because it's still too thick, scrape more
      off. The reed is probably not well balanced in this case, and
      where to remove wood should be visibly obvious. <br>
      </font></p>

      <h4><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Reed won't vibrate</font></h4>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">First, determine whether
      the sound of the reed is dull and wooden or whether it's thin
      and shrill. <br>
<br>
      If it's dull and wooden, removing wood from the heart usually
      fixes the problem. In extreme cases, you can even take wood from
      the center of the heart. Note that this will make the reed flatter.
      If the reed is dull and wooden and flat, it probably won't ever
      work.<br>
<br>
      If it's shrill, take more wood from the back. Continue scraping
      until the sound gets a little better, then balance the rest of
      the reed to what you've done. This will also make it flatter,
      but most shrill reeds are sharp so you're OK. Note that reeds
      that tend towards shrillness rarely turn out well.<br>
      </font></p>

      <h4><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Reed vibrates too much (raucous)</font></h4>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">This is often a good thing
      in the early stages, particularly with English horn reeds. Usually,
      the reed is well-balanced but just not finished. If this is the
      case, scrape equally from the tip, the heart, and the top of
      the back and try it again. Sometimes, raucousness in a nearly
      finished reed is the result of the opening being too large. If
      that's the case, squeeze it down before doing anything else.
      Usually, the reed will play completely differently with the correct
      opening. <br>
      </font></p>

      <h4><font size="-1" face="Helvetica"><br>
      GENERAL OBSERVATIONS</font></h4>

      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Sharpen your knife. This
        seems obvious but is often ignored anyway. Make sure it's really
        sharp before going anywhere near a reed. Spend ten minutes sharpening
        if necessary. Sharpen it five or ten times per reed. This cannot
        be emphasized enough! If you can't get your knife sharp, you
        might need a new one, or you might need to restore the edge using
        a coarser stone. A knife more than a year old is seldom much
        use unless it was extremely high quality to begin with and has
        been very carefully sharpened. Consider having one knife that
        you use only for the most delicate work. (This is not to say
        that the rough work should be done with a lousy knife! You need
        a good edge always.)</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Never deliberately remove
        wood from the center of the reed. Enough comes off anyway.</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">When in doubt, adjust the
        function of the reed, not the sound.The basic sound quality of
        a given piece of cane can only be adjusted within limits. It
        is not possible make a shrieking reed sound dull, nor is it possible
        to make a dead reed sound brilliant. It is possible, though,
        to make these reeds function correctly so that you can play with
        ease and comfort. You will always sound better on a reed that
        feels comfortable to you - you will be able to play in tune,
        with reliable response and without fatigue. Deficiencies in these
        areas are obvious to any listener - far more than delicate nuances
        of oboe tone.</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Make the extreme tip (corners
        and sides) as thin as you can. Measurements show that many reeds
        have tips that are .01mm thick (that's .00039 in. - 4/10,000).
        Sharpen your knife.</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Before doing anything, verify
        that the opening is the correct size. A too-large opening will
        completely distort a reed's performance.</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Think. Everything you do
        to a reed is a compromise.</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Unless you're completely
        sure of what you're doing, consider all of the effects of what
        you're doing on the four basic criteria of reed performance:
        response, resistance, tone quality and stability. A scraping
        operation will almost always give you the intended result, but
        it may also give a variety of unintended results which you must
        anticipate. Try to find the solution that solves the most problems
        and creates the fewest new ones.</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Try the reed after each
        operation. Don't decide you need to scrape the back, finish the
        tip and then clip it. Results are sometimes unpredictable. Do
        one thing at a time, and always try the reed.</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Learn to clip the tiniest
        amounts from the tip possible. If you can hardly see the remains
        on the block, it's about right.</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Consistency is more valuable
        than frequent experimentation.Try to find something that works
        and stick to it. The more consistent the process, the more consistent
        the result. Don't keep changing shaper tips, cane suppliers,
        staples, gouge dimensions, etc. Only a true expert (there aren't
        many) will be able to make sense of the various variables. Chances
        are, if your reeds don't play with shaper tip "A",
        they won't play with shaper tip "B", either.</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Consider the effects of
        tying the reed on at different lengths (while maintaining the
        same finished length). While it's best to keep the length fairly
        consistent, this presumes that you're using the same cane, shape,
        and type of tube for each reed. Tying the reed on shorter gives
        a smaller opening and a wider "throat" (the area where
        the reed meets the string). Tying the reed on longer has the
        opposite effect. Ideally, the sides should close with the string
        still one wind below the top of the tube. Tying on too long will
        cause the reed to leak; too short and the sides crush together
        causing the tip to spread apart.</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Make sure the overlap is
        correct. The blade facing you should be slightly to the right
        of the blade behind. That way the tension of the string wrapping
        pulls the two blades tightly together. Don't overlap too much
        - the resonance chamber is reduced too greatly. When tying on,
        I try to make sure that the overlap isn't going the wrong way
        more than I try to make it go the right way. If you tie left-handed
        (i.e. with the mandrel in your right hand, and the string in
        the left), the overlap should be reversed (the front blade slightly
        to the left of the rear).</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">The sides of the reed should
        hold tightly together all the way to the tip. If the sides are
        "loose" at all, the reed will almost never work well.
        This problem is usually caused by warped cane, careless shaping,
        or careless wrapping and cannot be solved by scraping. Be very
        careful with every step of the process, rejecting even slightly
        warped or twisted cane. Gouge carefully and measure each piece
        of gouged cane. Shape accurately with a sharp tool. Tie correctly
        onto the tube with the correct tie length. If you changed staple
        brands recently, change back.</font>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">Observe everything. Successful
      reedmaking is nothing more than an accumulation of experience
      and the elimination of error. This includes not only obvious
      errors like tearing off bits of tip and tying past the end of
      the tube, but also cane selection, careful gouging, shaping,
      tying-on, scraping, etc. Learn which types of cane work best
      for you. Which shapes, which tubes, which knives, etc. If you
      find something that works, stick to it. Most of all, think while
      you make reeds. Observe everything. You may ruin the reed you're
      working on, but make sure you learn something from the experience.

      <h4><font size="-1" face="Helvetica">ENGLISH HORN REEDS</font></h4>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica"><br>
      English horn reeds differ from oboe reeds in two important respects:
      they are not as "finished" as oboe reeds, and they
      generally have a wire.<br>
<br>
      Many oboe reeds have extremely thin tips and a rather thin back,
      especially just below the heart. If you make an English horn
      reed this way, it will sound small, dull, and may well be flat.
      Instead, make a reed that works well, is well balanced, but has
      less contrast between the three main areas - in other words:
      thicker tip, thinner heart, thicker back. In addition, the difference
      in thickness between the top of the back and the lower portions
      is not as pronounced. If viewed from the side, the "waistline"
      of the reed that appears just below the heart is lower down.
      If you want to think in terms of oboe reeds, make a reed that
      plays well but is not "refined".<br>
<br>
      The wire is not used to control the opening of the reed. If the
      opening is wrong, the reed will have the same problems with or
      without the wire. Rather, the wire stabilizes and focuses the
      tone of the notes above the staff. Often, this allows you to
      remove more wood from a reed that was sagging slightly before
      the wire. <br>
<br>
      Many reedmakers put the wire (#24 gauge brass wire from the hardware
      store, wound round the reed twice with pliers) on the blank before
      scraping at all. I prefer to add the wire later if necessary,
      since a reed without a wire will always vibrate more richly than
      with one. Having said that, I will admit that 90% of my English
      horn reeds end up with a wire on them. Don't wind it on so tightly
      that it grips all the way around the reed; stop as soon as you
      feel it gripping the sides. Don't put it up too high on the reed
      - 5-6 mm from the string (in other words, just into the beginning
      of the scraped area) is high enough. The wire will usually slide
      around when the reed is dry, but return to its proper position
      when the reed is soaked.</font>
